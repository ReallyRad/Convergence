TODO
- Firebaase backend for Signal Detection Measures (Nr of TP, FP, TN, FN) RT (duration for decision) with https://github.com/rotolonico/FirebaseWebGL
- Stop the Test after 15x presenting noise only
- First have large steps, then use 1DB steps â€“ maybe like here in Ableton:
- predefined 
- adjust the probaility of showing the Noise only file, and the 1 Up/1Down algorithm.
- on end screen show the signal detection values
- the number of tp, fp, tn, fn, mean reaction tiems, mean confidence ratings 

DONE 
- GUI flow
- end screen 
- Confidence Rating (VAS)
- skip through introductions.
- remove start OK button, switch panels when sound ends
- play sound on start sreen
- disable OK button 
- First 5 Trials without 33% Noise probability
