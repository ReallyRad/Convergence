TODO
- separate feedback for online and offline?

DONE 
- are key presses also detected when detection panel is not showing?
- first Practice Instructions must be called through event.
- split online and offline again, randomize. 
- don't include response time in trials where there is no sound for the average response time calculation (either true or false negative) Online or offline?
- reset perceptual threshold between online and offline.- hook yes no buttons up
- online offline instructions inverted
- timing? on button pressed or slider? separate slider and button?
- reset all values when switching between online/offline (current volume, always showing feedback)
- prevent OK if not answered.
- answer with keyboard in offline.
- log trial volume.
- change the volume in practice as well. do -5dB every time 
- set initial volume as serialized parameter so it can be adjusted
- first 5-8 trials of the main experiment always stimulus, (probability of not showing the melody is 0) Only when closer to the treshhold we should start presenting noise only trials. Actually  best thing would be to only start presentig noise only trials, when a confidence value of under 60% is given, to make sure we are at perceptual ambiguity. 
- have repo public in order to be able to host it on github pages
- test the web version on some hosting online
- merge online and offline in same rating. use the offline rating to decide the volume change.
- on end screen show the signal detection values
- merge online and offline so that we show yes/no buttons before the confidence rating. no longer need an OK button. 
- the number of tp, fp, tn, fn, mean reaction tiems, mean confidence ratings 
- reimplement volume decrease
- Firebaase backend for Signal Detection Measures (Nr of TP, FP, TN, FN) RT (duration for decision) 
- log answers for online and offline 
- Stop the Test after 15x presenting noise only
- see if better to implmeent firebase before feedback screen
- check if OK to have confidence response in timer when doing offline rating.
- adjust the probaility of showing the Noise only file, and the 1 Up/1Down algorithm.
- audio decrease logic
- GUI flow
- end screen 
- Confidence Rating (VAS)
- skip through introductions.
- remove start OK button, switch panels when sound ends
- play sound on start sreen
- disable OK button 
- First 5 Trials without 33% Noise probability
